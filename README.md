# "Hello There"

I am Jeremy, I'm a young coder working on fun projects for my entertainment because I have to much time on my hands. I work for myself building projects for fun and to help others. While my major projects are mostly private you can enjoy all my other projects.
For help with my projects feel free to join my discord server: https://discord.gg/RnbxGu6jYt or open a GitHub issue; Please don't contact me for no reason as it will be harder for me to provide help where its needed and its just annoying.

Older developers or nerds that don't have discord can email me [Here](mailto:ceojeremy@rainydais.com)
