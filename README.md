# "Hello There"

I am Jeremy, I'm a young coder working on fun projects for my entertainment because I have to much time on my hands. I work for myself building projects for fun and to help others.

For help with my projects feel free to join my discord server: https://discord.gg/RnbxGu6jYt or open a GitHub issue; Please don't contact me for no reason as it will be harder for me to provide help where its needed.

Older developers or nerds that don't have discord can email me [Here](mailto:ceojeremy@rainydais.com).

### My Stats:

### Languages I use:

### Why I Code:
One of the reasons I code is because I find it really fun to work through a challenge and find a solution that works fast and well.

Another one is, its fun to know what your doing and you get to meet really interesting people.

If you are trying to learn code and are struggling I would recommend sticking through it for a little while but remember it's not for everyone, and it's ok to stop for a little while. If your teaching yourself, find a strategy that works for you. *Please don't ask me for lessons, I am a awful teacher.*

### If I'm Not Active For A While:
**!THIS IS COMPLETELY NORMAL FOR ME!**

I'm probably working on a more private project or I just don't want to be online. If you need me send me an email for text me on discord.
