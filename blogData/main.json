          "text": "The reason the Boring Blog exists is simple, one of my friends Daniel Kellem [<a href='https://github.com/danielkellem'>GitHub</a>] started a blog called <a href='https://danielkellem.com/'>TECHNOSTOLOGY</a> and I felt inspired. A few months later I was sitting at my desk trying to think of a new project to work on. That's when it hit me. As if the world didn't have enough blogs already, I would build my own blog. The only difference is that I would code mine from the ground up. So I started work. A day or two later and countless changes to the code we have a working blog service where all the blog posts and data are controlled by a single file. As an added bonus its 100% open source.<br>-kgsensei [Jeremy]"
